# AutoInspect
## FYP

AutoInspect is a an automated inspection technique to make sure that surgical equipment are free of any visually examinable manufacturing fault

## Methodology

To solve the problem of automated inspection of surgical equipment we have opted the following ways:

- [Pre_Processing & Augmentation] - Used image processing tecniques to prepare our dataset for defect detection
- [Image_Processing Solutions] - Used  reference based and contour based image processing tecniques for defect detection
- [YOLOv5s] - a fine tunned YOLOv5s model for defect detection
- [ImageNet Architectures] - Different pre-trained models for defect detection
- [Defect-Net] - A custom CNN model from scratch
